## **Overview**
**Dev Block** is an **interactive, community-driven platform** for developers to:
- Publish **blogs** and **tutorials**
- Share **code snippets**
- Collaborate and discuss ideas via threaded comments
- Run live code with an **integrated code playground**

It centralizes **tech learning, collaboration, and practical coding** in one platform.

---

## **Inspiration**
Dev Block started as **Code Blog**, a markdown-powered blog for coding tutorials and tech insights. It evolved into a feature-rich platform supporting:
- Multiple content types (blogs, tutorials, snippets)
- Real-time code execution
- Engagement features (likes, bookmarks, comments)

The **Primary Goal** is to provide a **single space where developers write, run, and refine ideas** while connecting with the community.
