It gives developers **direct control over system resources**, including memory and hardware, which enables them to write efficient, optimized code. This makes C++ the language of choice for applications where performance is critical, such as **real-time systems** and **game development**.

Additionally, C++ supports **object-oriented programming**, which allows developers to create modular, reusable code through concepts like **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, and **polymorphism**. These features help in building scalable and maintainable software, especially for large projects.

C++ also excels at **generic programming** through the use of **templates**, allowing developers to write flexible and reusable algorithms and data structures. This reduces code duplication and improves efficiency, making C++ well-suited for creating complex systems.

Finally, C++ has a large, active **community** and a rich ecosystem of **libraries** and **frameworks**, such as **Boost** and **Qt**, that help streamline development. Regular updates to the C++ standard, such as **C++11**, **C++14**, **C++17**, and **C++20**, continue to introduce new features and optimizations, ensuring that C++ remains relevant in modern software development.

In summary, C++ is a powerful language offering **high performance**, **flexibility**, and **cross-platform capabilities**, making it an excellent choice for a wide range of software development needs.

int main() {
    int age = 25;
    double height = 5.9;
    char initial = 'A';

    std::cout << "Age: " << age << ", Height: " << height << ", Initial: " << initial << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Control Structures

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int age = 20;

    if (age >= 18) {
        std::cout << "You are an adult." << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "You are a minor." << std::endl;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        std::cout << "Count: " << i << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Functions

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void greet(std::string name) {
    std::cout << "Hello, " << name << "!" << std::endl;

    int real, imag;

    Complex(int r = 0, int i = 0) : real(r), imag(i) {}

    Complex operator + (const Complex &obj) {
        return Complex(real + obj.real, imag + obj.imag);
    }

    void display() {
        std::cout << real << " + " << imag << "i" << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Complex c1(3, 4), c2(1, 2);
    Complex c3 = c1 + c2;

    c3.display();
    return 0;
}
```

### Exception Handling

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    try {
        int a = 10, b = 0;
        if (b == 0)
            throw "Division by zero error!";
        std::cout << a / b << std::endl;
    } catch (const char* msg) {
        std::cerr << msg << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
